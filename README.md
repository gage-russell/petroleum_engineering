fbprophet_DCA2.0.py does decline curve analysis for any number of wells downloaded as production time series csv from drillinginfo (download the production time series csv from drillinginfo for any number of wells and leave it exactly as is). Only thing to change is path to file.Currently trying to decide how to best add graphing/visualization features.
*Uncomment out m.plot(fcst) to plot each forecast (not a good idea for lots of wells).
